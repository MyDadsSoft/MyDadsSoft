### 🚀 About Me
I started my tech journey back in **2019**, diving into **C++**, **C#**, **Java**, **HTML**, and **Python**.  
Before long, I was jailbreaking iPhones (until **iOS 18** ended that chapter) and learning **reverse engineering** on the **Xbox 360** and **PS3** — that’s where my love for systems and code really started.

Now I’m focused on:
- 🪟 Building **WPF applications** (desktop tools & utilities)
- 🧩 Creating **mods for Minecraft** and other games/programs
- ⚙️ Exploring **software architecture**, **reverse engineering**, and **creative coding**
